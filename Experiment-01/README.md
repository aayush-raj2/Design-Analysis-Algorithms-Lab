# Experiment – 01
## Sorting Using Heap and AVL Tree

### 🎯 Aim
To develop a menu-driven C/C++ program to sort a list of elements using
**Heap** and **AVL Tree** data structures and analyze their working mechanisms
and performance.

---

### 📚 Description
This experiment demonstrates sorting using:
- **Heap Sort** (Array-based technique)
- **AVL Tree Sort** (Self-balancing Binary Search Tree)

A menu-driven program allows the user to choose the sorting technique.

---

### 🧪 Algorithms Used
1. Heap Sort
2. AVL Tree (Inorder Traversal gives sorted order)

---

### ⏱️ Time Complexity
| Technique | Best | Average | Worst |
|--------|------|---------|-------|
| Heap Sort | O(n log n) | O(n log n) | O(n log n) |
| AVL Tree Sort | O(n log n) | O(n log n) | O(n log n) |

---

### 🛠️ How to Run
```bash
g++ heap_avl_sort.cpp -o exp1
./exp1
```
---

### 📌 Learning Outcome

- Understand heap-based sorting

- Learn self-balancing AVL trees

- Compare performance of tree-based and array-based sorting
