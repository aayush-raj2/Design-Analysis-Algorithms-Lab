# Greedy Algorithms – Huffman Coding & Knapsack

## 📌 Overview
This repository contains implementations of two fundamental Greedy algorithms:

1. Huffman Coding (Optimal Prefix Coding)
2. Fractional Knapsack (Greedy Strategy)

Both algorithms are implemented in:
- C
- C++

---

## 🚀 Algorithms Included

### 1️⃣ Huffman Coding
Huffman Coding is a greedy algorithm used for data compression.  
It builds an optimal prefix tree based on character frequencies.

Time Complexity: O(n log n)  
Space Complexity: O(n)

Key Concept:
- Always combine two minimum frequency nodes
- Use Min-Heap / Priority Queue

Applications:
- File compression
- ZIP, JPEG encoding concepts

---

### 2️⃣ Fractional Knapsack (Greedy)
The Fractional Knapsack problem maximizes profit by selecting items based on highest value/weight ratio.

Time Complexity: O(n log n) (due to sorting)

Key Concept:
- Sort items by value/weight ratio
- Pick maximum ratio first
- Fractions allowed
