# Merge Sort and Binary Search (C & C++)

## 📌 Overview
This repository contains implementations of:

- Merge Sort (Divide and Conquer Sorting Algorithm)
- Binary Search (Efficient Searching Algorithm)

Both algorithms are implemented in:
- C
- C++

---

## 🚀 Algorithms Included

### 1️⃣ Merge Sort
- Technique: Divide and Conquer
- Time Complexity: O(n log n)
- Space Complexity: O(n)
- Stable Sorting Algorithm

### 2️⃣ Binary Search
- Works only on sorted arrays
- Time Complexity: O(log n)
- Space Complexity: O(1)
